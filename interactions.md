### Chicken Milk Gravy Over Toast

#### Ingredients:

**For the Chicken:**
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 lb)
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

**For the Milk Gravy:**
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1 chicken bouillon cube (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional spices: ¬Ω teaspoon dried thyme or oregano

**For the Toast:**
- 4 slices of rustic bread (like sourdough or ciabatta)
- Butter, for spreading

**Garnish:**
- Fresh parsley, chopped

#### Preparation Steps:

**1. Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a bowl, combine the buttermilk, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken breasts, ensuring they are well coated. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.

**2. Cook the Chicken:**
   - Preheat your oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C). 
   - In an oven-safe skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and let any excess drip off before placing it in the skillet. 
   - Sear the chicken for about 5 minutes on each side until golden brown.
   - It is then finished in the oven for about 15 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165¬∞F (75¬∞C). Once done, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing it into strips.

**3. Prepare the Milk Gravy:**
   - In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, sprinkle in the flour, whisking constantly to form a roux (cook for about 2 minutes, until light golden brown).
   - Gradually add the milk while continuously whisking to avoid lumps. 
   - If you‚Äôre using a bouillon cube, crumble it into the sauce at this point. Continue to whisk until the gravy thickens (about 5-7 minutes). 
   - Season with salt, pepper, and optional dried herbs to taste. Remove from heat.

**4. Toast the Bread:**
   - While preparing the gravy, toast the slices of rustic bread on a skillet or toaster until golden and crispy. Once golden, spread a knob of butter on each slice.

**5. Assemble the Dish:**
   - Place the buttered toast on individual plates. Layer the sliced chicken on top of each piece of toast, followed by pouring a generous amount of milk gravy over the chicken.

**6. Garnish:**
   - Finally, sprinkle some freshly chopped parsley over the dish for color and freshness.

**7. Serve and Enjoy:**
   - Serve immediately while hot to maintain the comforting taste and texture that makes this dish so irresistible!

There you have it! Chicken Milk Gravy Over Toast is a dish that perfectly balances savory and creamy flavors, all while being an absolute showstopper. Enjoy creating this dish and remember, cooking is all about experimenting and having fun!
