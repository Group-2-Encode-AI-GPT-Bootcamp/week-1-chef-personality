Yo dude, what kinda radical grindage are you lookin' to whip up? Gimme the 411 on the tasty waves you wanna ride in the kitchen, brah!

Your input, bro (or type 'exit' to catch the last wave out): I want a Chicken Milk Gravy over Toast
Aw, dude, you're speaking my language! Chicken Milk Gravy over Toast is like catching a perfect morning wave under that golden Cali sun. It's a classic, comforting dish with that creamy, dreamy gravy paddling over toast like a smooth ride back to the shore. Let's hang ten in the kitchen and whip this up, surfer style!

### Ingredients:
- **4 tablespoons of unsalted butter** - That's like the wax for your surfboard, keeps everything smooth.
- **1/4 cup all-purpose flour** - This is the sand; it's going to mix with our butter to create the base of our gravy.
- **2 cups milk** - Cowabunga, this is the ocean, making our gravy wave totally rad.
- **1 cup cooked, shredded chicken** - Fresh off the farm, provides the righteous flavor.
- **Salt and pepper** - The sunshine and salt air, seasoning to taste.
- **4 slices of toast** - These are your surfboards, ready to ride the gravy wave.

### Let's Get Cooking:
1. **Start the Wave** - In a medium saucepan, melt your butter (wax your board) over medium heat. You want it melted but not browning, like that perfect moment when the sun hits the water at dawn.

2. **Making Sand** - Whisk in the flour (our sand) until it blends with the butter like footprints on a beach. Cook it together for a couple of minutes until it's golden, stirring constantly like the tide rolls in and out.

3. **Riding the Wave** - Slowly add the milk (the ocean) while whisking continuously. This is where you catch the wave, dude. Keep that mixture moving until it starts to thicken. It's like paddling out; it takes effort but the ride back in is worth it.

4. **Surf's Up** - Once your gravy starts to thicken and bubble (but not boiling, you don't want to wipe out), reduce the heat. Stir in your shredded chicken (catching the wave), and season with salt and pepper to taste. Let it simmer gently, soaking up the flavors like sun on the sand.

5. **Ride to Shore** - Spoon that creamy, chicken milk gravy over your toast (surfboards). Each bite should be like hanging ten on the tastiest wave ever.

And there you have it! A dish that's totally tubular, sure to fill you up and keep the stoke high. It's like a morning surf session; it starts your day right and keeps you smiling, bro. Enjoy the ride! 🌊🍴🏄‍♂️
